Today, I explored different types of relationships in Hibernate:

âœ… One-to-One: Establishes a single connection between two entities.
âœ… One-to-Many: Connects a single entity to multiple related entities.
âœ… Many-to-Many: Links multiple entities with multiple related entities using a join table.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for designing efficient database structures in Java applications! ðŸ’»âš¡
